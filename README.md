folder c-based-bootstrapping can be migrated into host directly. It provides a benchmark of low-end Bootstrapping implementation on coretax-a57/a72.

folder doub-float-test proves that double computation can be split into float computation, indicating that we can develop bootstrapping functions on low-end processors (such as, RISC).
